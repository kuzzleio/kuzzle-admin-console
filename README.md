# Kuzzle Admin Console

> The Kuzzle Admin Console allows you to manage your Kuzzle instance. Use it to administer your data, subscriptions and Kuzzle configuration.

# About Kuzzle

Kuzzle is an open-source backend solution that comes equipped with out-of-the-box features to enable real-time collaboration, geofencing, security, and other advanced functionality.

Kuzzle provides a secure API which can be accessed through a large selection of protocols such as REST, Websocket or Message Queuing.

# Using Kuzzle Admin Console

The Kuzzle Admin Console is a static front-end client which runs in your web browser and connects to Kuzzle. This means that your Kuzzle installation must be accessible from the computer running the Kuzzle Admin Console. To connect to Kuzzle you will need to provide your Kuzzle installation host (name or IP) and the port (default: 7512).

You can get the latest version of the Kuzzle Admin Console [here](http://console.kuzzle.io) (or if you're using Kuzzle through SSL, you can use the [https](https://console.kuzzle.io) version)

To get a working copy of the Admin Console on your computer, you can download it here: https://dl.kuzzle.io/admin-console/kuzzle-admin-console.tar.gz

To build the Kuzzle Admin Console on your computer, follow these instructions:

- `git clone https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-admin-console` : Clone this repository
