# kuzzle-backoffice

> A handy back-office for Kuzzle.io

:warning: This is a very early stage refactoring of [https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-bo](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-bo)


This is a very very WIP implementation of the Kuzzle.io back-office. It is based
on Vue.js and provides you a web interface to easily manage your Kuzzle instance.
